                        <p>The Path to Wholeness is about getting back to your inner power. It is based on a principle that you are intrinsically whole and complete <br> and the goal is to help you get back to that place.</p> <br>
                        <p>The answers are already within you. You already know what to do. However, you might be disconnected from that place and need help<br>rediscovering your center. Therapeutic approach that I use helps people to find their way back to their strength, power, and acceptance.</p> <br>
