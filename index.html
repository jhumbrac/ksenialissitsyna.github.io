                        <p>The Path to Wholeness is about getting back to your inner power. It is based on a principle that you are intrinsically whole and complete <br> and the goal is to help you get back to that place.</p> <br>
                        <p>The answers are already within you. You already know what to do. However, you might be disconnected from that place and need help<br>rediscovering your center. Therapeutic approach that I use helps people to find their way back to their strength, power, and acceptance.</p> <br>

                               <p>Individual therapy supports us in identifying, creating, and understanding ourselves. Often, therapy will integrate group or family therapy into treatment because of the level of validation, empathy, and sympathy that one experiences.</p>
                               <p>Couples therapy is geared towards empowering individuality, while also cultivating and respecting a new identity as a couple. This treatment will support the couple in improving communication and trust to allow for a solid foundation.</p>
                               <p>Each chakra represents an aspect of higher consciousness that is essential to a person’s life. As a system, the seven chakras integrate a person’s mind, body and spirit; and each has a physical, emotional, creative, and celestial component. </p>        
                              <p>Past life therapy is an opportunity for you to visit the source of the issue to release the past. Like therapy, it is remembering and re-experiencing which heals. And in accessing your Higher Self, your soul, you can connect with a peace, a wisdom, and a perspective ordinarily unavailable.<p>
