                                        <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
                                        <p>Therapy supports us in identifying, creating, and understanding ourselves. Often, therapy will integrate group or family therapy into treatment because of the level of validation, empathy, and sympathy that one experiences</p>

                                        <p>Each chakra represents an aspect of higher consciousness that is essential to a person’s life. As a system, the seven chakras integrate a person’s mind, body and spirit; and each has a physical, emotional, creative, and celestial component.</p>

                                        <h2>Past Life Regression</h2>
                                        <p>Past life therapy is an opportunity for you to visit the source of the issue to release the past. Like therapy, it is remembering and re-experiencing which heals. And in accessing your Higher Self, your soul, you can connect with a peace, a wisdom, and a perspective ordinarily unavailable.</p>

                                        <p>I am a Marriage and Family therapist registered intern practicing under supervision of Don Hadlock, licensed MFT (license #) in Campbell.</p>
                                        <p>I have graduated from Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in 2014 with a Master's in Counseling Psychology and have been working with children and their families since then. I use a direct, experiential, process-oriented approach in my work and combine it with Jungian, Humanistic, and Cognitive-Behavioral techniques.</p>
                                        <p>I have experience of working with depression, psychosis, anxiety, trauma, and spirituality-related issues. </p>
