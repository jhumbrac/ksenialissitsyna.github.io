                                        <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
                                        <p>Therapy supports us in identifying, creating, and understanding ourselves. Often, therapy will integrate group or family therapy into treatment because of the level of validation, empathy, and sympathy that one experiences</p>

                                        <h2>Past Life Regression</h2>
                                        <p>Past life therapy is an opportunity for you to visit the source of the issue to release the past. Like therapy, it is remembering and re-experiencing which heals. And in accessing your Higher Self, your soul, you can connect with a peace, a wisdom, and a perspective ordinarily unavailable.</p>
